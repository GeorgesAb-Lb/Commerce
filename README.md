# commerce
This is my commerce project, commerce is an online auction where people can login/signup to their accounts, logout from their account and they can check all the active listings items that others have listed and bid on them, they can even add any item to their watchlist if they are interested in it, they can also leave a comment on the listing which will be displayed with their username above it, the person with the highest bid when the owner of the listed item closes the auction, Wins. Anyone with a valid account can create a listing and set it's starting price to > 0, from there the listing will be public in the active listings page and others will be able to start bidding on it.
